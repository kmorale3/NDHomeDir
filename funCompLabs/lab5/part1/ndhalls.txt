There are currently 33 undergraduate residence halls at the University of Notre Dame, including 32 active residence halls and Pangborn Hall, which serves as a transition dorm when residence halls undergo construction. Several of the halls are historic buildings which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[1] Each residence hall is single-sex, with 17 all-male residence halls and 14 all-female residence halls.[2] Notre Dame residence halls feature a mixed residential college and house system, where residence halls are the center of the student life and some academic teaching; most students stay at the same hall for most of their undergraduate studies.[3][4] Each hall has its own traditions, events, mascot, sports teams, shield, motto, and dorm pride.[5][6][7] The university also hosts Old College, an undergraduate residence for students preparing for the priesthood.

Notre Dame has an undergraduate hall system which blends the residential college system and the house system.[8] All first-year students are placed in one of the 31 halls upon enrollment, and students rarely switch halls. Each hall has its own spirit, tradition, mascot, sport teams, events, dances and reputation. Approximately 80% of undergraduate students live on campus, and often a student lives in the same dorm for the entirety of their undergraduate career.[9] A huge segment of student life happens through residence halls and students develop a particular attachment to their undergraduate hall. Each residence hall is directed by one Rector with the assistance of two Assistant Rectors and a variable number of Resident Assistants (from 4 to 9). Every residence hall has a chapel where Mass is held multiple time per week, fields a variety of intramural sports teams, elects one senator to represent the dorm in Student Government, and elects a president and vice president(s) which work through the Hall Presidents Council (HPC) student organization. Interhall football between Notre Dame male dorms is the only interhall tackle football which has remained at any US university.[10] Notre Dame residence halls are the center of the campus student life, and each one hosts signature events, like the Keenan Revue,[11] the Zahm Hall Bun run,[12] Fisher Regatta,[13] the Siegfried Day of Man, The Dillon Hall Pep Rally [14][15] and many others. Each dorm has its own architectural features, some of which were designed by famous architects such as Willoughby J. Edbrooke, Maginnis & Walsh and Thomas Ellerbe, and each hall has a chapel dedicated to the Hall's patron saint.[16]

With the exception of Carroll Hall, the residence halls are split among six main segments of the campus: Main (God) Quad, South Quad, North Quad, Mod Quad, West Quad, and East Quad. (Carroll has its own lawn, by Saint Mary's Lake, informally called "Far Quad.") All first-year students are not only guaranteed on-campus housing, but are required to reside on campus for at least six semesters, starting with the Class of 2022.[7] Many of the halls were inserted in 1973 on the National Register of Historic Places.[17][18]

Breen-Phillips hall is on North Quad, between Farley Hall, Geddes Hall, and the Hesburgh Library. Established in 1939, it hosts 200 students.

History
In the 1930s, enrollment at Notre Dame was increasing by about one hundred a year, but on campus space was limited. This both forced students to live far from campus and was a loss of potential room and board income for the university.[54] President John Francis O'Hara decided to build three new residence halls to remedy this problem: Cavanaugh in 1936, Zahm in 1937, and Breen-Phillips in 1939. In order to accommodate these buildings it was necessary to demolish Freshman and Sophomore Halls (which were low quality temporary structures) and the east wing of St. Edward's Hall. Breen-Phillips was built on the east end of the Fieldhouse and formed the eastern edge of the new North Quad.[54] Groundbreaking took place on March 27, construction started May 5, and the cornerstone was laid May 5, 1939 and blessed by president O'Hara.[55] It was built in collegiate Gothic style (although less elaborate and ornate than Alumni and Dillon) by Boston-based architects Maginnis and Walsh, who worked on several other projects at Notre Dame.[54] It was built in 165 days, and it was ready to host 185 freshmen on September 8 and its first rector was Rev. George Holderith, CSC.[56]


Breen-Phillips
Construction cost more than $300,000 and was donated by brothers-in-law benefactors attorney William P. Breen (class of 1877) and banker Frank B. Phillips (class of 1880), both from Fort Wayne.[57][55] Breen, who was admitted to the Indiana bar in 1879, was member of the firm Breen & Morris, member of the American Bar Association and of the Indiana Bar Association, of which he was president 1903-1904. He was also director of the Notre Dame Board of Trustees, president of the Alumni Association in 1908-1909, and benefactor of the Breen Medal for oratory.[58]

Originally, it was a Freshman hall and it hosted the athletics department on its first floor, including the football coach Frank Leahy's office, and the football ticket office.[59][56] It hosted naval officers during World War II when the university was used by the Navy for training purposes.[57][60] During the 1960s the dorm was known as Stalag B-P, a riff on the 1953 film Stalag 17 about a German prisoner-of-war camp during World War II, in reference to the strictness of the rector of the time, who was also of German descent.[61]

It was converted in a female dorm in 1973.[62] In 2014 it celebrated its 75th anniversary with a series of events.[63]

The Sister Mary Catherine McNamara served as rector from 2012 to 2018, and she held Bachelor of Science from St. John College of Cleveland and a Master of Science in Education from the University of Akron.[64] The current rector is Angie Hollar, a Mishawaka native who earned a Bachelor’s degree in Social Work from Saint Mary’s College in 2011 and then entered the Advanced Standing Master of Social Work program at the University of Pennsylvania, followed by a Master of Divinity degree at the Jesuit School of Theology at Santa Clara University.[65]

Description
The hall is a four-story brick building built in vernacular collegiate gothic architecture, but without elaborate decorations found in other neo-gothic buildings such as Alumni or Morrissey.[54] The basement features a 24-Hour Hang-Out Space (the Pen), a Kitchen, a Study room, a Pink 'cafe' room (mainly used for studying and meetings). a Workout room (treadmills, ellipticals, weights, etc), a Laundry room, and a Movie room (movies, TV, & books!). The chapel, dedicated to Francis of Assisi, is located on the 1st floor.[66] It has entrances on each side of the building, facing Farley Hall, North Quad, and the Fieldhouse mall. It is staffed by one rector, two assistant rectors, and six resident assistants, one for each of the six sections.[66]

Traditions
The nickname was once the Banshees,[57] but this was changed to Babes after the 1998 movie Babe: Pig in the City.[61] This was also a nod to a recurring joke about Breen-Phillips as "the overweight dorm" on the Keenan Revue. This joke originated when off-campus ice cream eatery started a promotional contest among dorms with a prize for the dorm that ordered the most ice-cream. When resident of Keenan Hall went to the shop, they said they were from B-P instead, leading to a landslide victory for BP in the contest and the reputation as ice-cream devourers.[61][67]

A traditional event of B-P is the Bathrobe Breakfast, when the ladies of B.P. have their lunch at the dining hall in their pajamas. Another signature event is the B-P Meal Auction, which raises money for Meals on Wheels.[68][69] The coat of arms is based on the family shield of the Breen and Phillips families, with the colors adapted to match those of the hall and the lion was changed into a pig, the mascot of Breen-Phillips hall.

Cavanaugh Hall is located directly south of Zahm Hall and is directly north of LaFortune Student Center. Cavanaugh houses around 200 undergraduate students. Its central location gives the dorm a good view of the golden dome. The coat of arms is taken from the family arms of the Cavanaugh Family, with the colors adapted to match the green and purple of the hall.[72]


Cavanaugh Hall
History
In the 1930s, enrollment at Notre Dame was increasing by about one hundred a year, but on campus space was limited. This both forced students to live far from campus and was a loss of potential room and board income for the university.[54] President John Francis O'Hara decided to build three new residence halls to remedy this problem: Cavanaugh in 1936, Zahm in 1937, and Breen-Phillips in 1939. In order to accommodate these buildings it was necessary to demolish Freshman and Sophomore Halls (which were low quality temporary structures) and the east wing of St. Edward's Hall.[73]

It was named after Notre Dame's fifth president, Rev. John W. Cavanaugh, who has died only a year earlier.[73] It was originally constructed to be the most northern and eastern building for the campus, however, this changed a year later when Zahm Hall was built. Architects were Maginnis and Walsh of Boston in a collegiate Gothic style, although less ornate and decorated than Alumni and Dillon Halls.[73] During World War II, Cavanaugh, along with four other dorms, housed naval officers-in-training. Father Matthew Miceli served as Rector of Cavanaugh Hall from 1963 to 1990, holding the record at the time as longest-serving Rector of the same residence hall. He was beloved by the residents and affectionately referred to as “The Mooch”. In 1994, with female enrollment to the university increasing, the dorm was converted to a female dorm. The Chapel is dedicated to the Holy Spirit.[74]

The current rector is Lauren Donahue.

Traditions
In the 1980s, its residents were called the Cavemen, supposedly in recognition of its large, cavernous basement, but more likely because Cavemen has the same first three letters as the Hall's name. An attempt was made to change the name to the Crusaders in 1988. The name was changed to the Cavaliers in 1994 and then to the Chaos.[75] A tradition winter ball called the Snowball is held every winter; many related activities take place in the preceding week. Mother-Daughter and Father-Daughter weekend are held alternatively in spring.

Duncan Hall is the second newest male dorm on campus. It is located on West Quad, between McGlinn Hall and the Golf Course.

History
Duncan was built as the first of four new dorms built by the university to alleviate overcrowding in the existing residence halls. It was the first built since the completion of the original four West Quad dorms (Welsh Family, Keough, O'Neill, and McGlinn) in 1996/1997. It fills the space of former volleyball courts west of McGlinn Hall, filling the quad out to its western limit at Holy Cross Drive.


Duncan Hall
Duncan Hall is named for its benefactor Raymond T. Duncan, Notre Dame class of 1952, a personal friend of Joe O'Neill, benefactor of O'Neill Family Hall (also on West Quad). The Duncan family has strong family ties to the University, including Duncan's father Walter (class of 1912), two of his brothers and two of his sons.[77]

The dorm broke ground in March 2007 and was completed in 17 months, on schedule, to be opened for its first residents during ordinary move-in in August 2008. Mackey Mitchell Architects was the designer of this project.

The dorm incorporates features such as super-quads, which include private bathrooms, and super-doubles with bay windows, as well as a study lounge and social space in every section, 24-hour space with a large kitchen that hosts a food-service business called the Highlander Grille, and a basement with an exercise room.[78] The rooms are larger than typical on-campus dorm rooms, and the dorm is generally viewed as relatively luxurious.

The inaugural freshman class was filled, as with any other dorm, by the random process of the Office of Residence Life and Housing. Residents from other three classes, however, were selected through a random lottery process six months prior to move-in, choosing 150 students from a voluntary applicant pool.[79]


Duncan Hall
On Friday, October 3, 2008, Duncan Hall was formally dedicated, an event marked by a Mass in the chapel presided over by Fr. John Jenkins, University president, and attended by the Duncan family and distinguished guests as well as the dorm's residents and hall staff.

Traditions
The signature event of Duncan Hall is Highlander Highrise, a formal ball held on the 99th floor of Willis Tower in Chicago.[80] The Duncan Classic is a golf tournament held in the spring. Each class of first years participate in the Green Blazer Ceremony, where first year Highlanders receive a green sport coat embroidered with the Duncan Hall Crest, representing the class and unity the men of Duncan Hall share under the motto of Community, Brotherhood, and Respect.

Farley Hall is a female dorm. It is located on North Quad between Breen-Phillips Hall and North Dining Hall.[81] It was named after Rev. John "Pop" Falrey, C.S.C.[82]


Farley Hall
History
After World War II, Notre Dame saw a large increase in its student population, partially due to the influx of veterans under the new G.I. Bill. A record 4,400 students attended in 1946.[83] To accommodate the increased population, president Hugh O'Donnell announced in 1946 the construction of a new hall north of Breen-Phillips, originally only known as "Project F", but later revealed to be named after John "Pop" Farley.[84][85]

John "Pop" O' Farley was one of the most well-known and beloved Notre Dame figures at the time.[84][86] A native of Paterson, in 1897 he came to Notre Dame to study for the priesthood. A very gifted athlete, he earned nine varsity monograms: four in football, four in baseball, and one in track. As a senior, he was the captain of the 1900 Notre Dame football team with a 6-3-1 record under head coach Pat O’Dea. He graduated in 1901, entered Holy Cross Seminary, and ordained a Holy Cross priest in 1907. He the remaining 32 of his life at Notre Dame, with the exception of some years at the University of Portland.[86] He served as the rector for Corby, Walsh, and Sorin Halls, where he gained a reputation as a strict disciplinarian and thanks to his track speed, he could chase rule breakers across the campus. He was known to patrol the streets of South Bend by driving the university’s horse-powered “Skive Wagon.” Despite his gruff attitude and the fact he never taught classes or preached on campus, he was known as a great counselor for students and was much beloved and a campus favorite, and he earned the paternal nickname "Pop".[84][87][86] As a rector, he was hugely involved in his dorm's interhall sports competitions, and did not miss attending sports events even after his leg was amputated after he suffered a stroke in 1937. He died on 15 January 1939 and was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery.[88] In his honor, the Rev. John Francis "Pop" Farley, C.S.C. Award has been awarded since 1977 to university employees who distinguished themselves in service to students.[89]

Construction, which cost $730,000 began in the summer of 1946 and was concluded in time for the semester beginning September 1947. In February 1947, Rev. Joseph D. Barry, C.S.C. was announced as the first rector of the yet to be completed Farley Hall. Barry was known as the “front-line chaplain” who won the Silver Star and had landed in Sicily in July 1943 and was involved in battles at Salerno, Anzio, Southern France, and Germany with the 45th Army Division.[90]

Farley Hall offered a variety of rooms including singles, doubles, triples, and quads. The hall rectors for the 1948-49 academic year were reported in the September-October issue of the Notre Dame Alumnus magazine. Rev. Theodore Hesburgh was appointed as the new rector of Farley Hall for the 1948-1949 year, before being appointed later in 1948 as the executive vice president of the university.[91] Rev. Charles Sheedy, C.S.C. succeeded Father Hesburgh as rector for the 1949-50 academic year.

In 1965, together with Alumni and Dillon, it was the first dorm to try the "stay-hall" system, in which residents could stay all four years in the same hall rather than being divided by class as they were up until the 1960s.[92] Farley became one of the 5 original women's dorms in 1973 when the university opened its doors to women. Sr. Jean Lenz was the first female rector and wrote of her experiences in her book, Loyal Sons and Daughters.[93]

Fisher Hall is a male dorm located on South Quad, between South Dining Hall and Pangborn Hall (University of Notre Dame).


Fisher Hall
History
After World War II, Notre Dame saw a large increase in its student population, partially due to the influx of veterans under the new G.I. Bill. A record 4,400 students attended in 1946.[83] To accommodate the increased population, president John J Cavanaugh initiated the construction of Farley Hall. The hall, which cost $762,00, was made possible due a 1 million dollar donation by Sally Fisher in honor of her late husband, Fred J. Fisher, the first president of the Fisher Body Company in Detroit, and former member of the Board of Trustees.[94] The remaining money was allotted for financial aid for students. Originally it was meant to be built north of Falrey Hall (where the North Dining Hall stands today), but it was later changed to the present location.[95]

It was constructed in 1952 by Peter Schumacher and Sons Construction Co. of Mishawaka in the shape of a T. The original plans had to be adapted due to rising costs, and while the east wing was built with four floors, the west wing (containing the chapel) was only built to one floor, and the north-south wing only to two (although more were added later).[95] When it opened, it contained 120 single rooms and 18 doubles and a social lounge, study room, and recreation room, and it was reserved for upperclassmen.[95] It was flat roofed and not built in the traditional collegiate Gothic style of South Quad.[96]

Summer 2001 renovations included a new social space and a new chapel. Over the years, renovations to Fisher Hall have created a mix of single, double, and quad rooms. Fisher Hall contains more single rooms than most other dorms at Notre Dame, and consequently receives several students who "float" for singles from across campus.

Fisher's sister dorms are Howard and Badin.[97]

Traditions
Fisher Hall's signature event is the Fisher Regatta, hosted annually at the end of the spring semester. The regatta was founded by freshman Jay Farraher (class of 1990) in 1987. Various dorms compete by submitting homemade boat entries in races on Saint Mary's Lake, located on campus.


The large green F outside Fisher Hall
In the fall of 2002, a second signature event, the Fisher Hall Roofsit, was created to benefit a selected charity by having hall members sit on the roof of Fisher for 50 consecutive hours to commemorate the then 50th anniversary of the hall's construction. This event has been expanded over recent years to include a campus-wide dodgeball tournament, musical performances, and other social events. As of 2015, due to pressure from the university, the roofsit was discontinued.

A big "F" letter hangs on the side of the hall. The original insignia was placed in the 80s but was stolen by the residents of Pangborn Hall in 1991. It was replaced with a bigger plastic letter.

History
Marilyn M. Keough Hall was dedicated on September 27, 1996. It is located on West Quad across from South Dining Hall with neighbors McGlinn Hall, O'Neill Family Hall, and Welsh Family Hall. Keough Hall is named after Marilyn Keough, wife of Donald Keough, who served as chairman of Notre Dame's Board of Trustees from 1986–1992. It was built as one of several replacement dorms for Flanner Hall and Grace Hall, both of which were turned into administrative buildings.[98]


Main entrance to Keough Hall
Fr. Tom Doyle, C.S.C. served as Keough Hall's first Rector. Upon completing his Seminary training, he helped to dedicate Marilyn M. Keough Hall in August 1996. Fr. Tom was ordained a priest in the Congregation of Holy Cross in the Spring of 1998 amidst his family, friends and 250 spirited young Men of Keough Hall. Doyle now serves as the Executive Vice President of University Relations at the University of Portland. Fr. Pete Jarret, C.S.C. arrived as rector in 2001 and led the community until 2006. Mark DeMott served as interim rector for the 2006-2007 school year. Keough Hall's current Rector is Deacon Brogan Ryan, CSC.

Traditions
Despite its young history, Keough Hall residents have established themselves as an up-and-coming dorm community with great enthusiasm and brotherhood, winning Men's Hall of the Year in 2009.

Every fall the dorm hosts the Keough Hall Chariot Race, in which the different sections within Keough, as well as other dorms, build chariots to race against one another. This signature event lasts all day and is followed that night by a dance. In the spring, Keough once held a dance formal called the White Wedding in which the members of the dorm create a comical mock wedding ceremony for other members of the dorm and their dates. Late in the year the dorm hosts the Aussie Fest, which usually wraps up the year with a cookout, games and music.

Knott Hall, a male dorm, is located on Mod Quad close to Siegfried Hall and the Theodore Hesburgh Library.[99]

History

West side of Knott Hall, giving on Mod Quad
It was built in 1988 as a women's hall and named after Marion Burk Knott since the money was donated by Baltimore philanthropist and businessman Henry Joseph Knott. It was the home of the Knott Angels.

When Grace and Flanner male dorms became administrative offices, residents from Flanner moved to Keough Hall and O'Neill Family Hall. In order to maintain gender balance, female residents of Siegfried and Knott moved to Welsh Family Hall and McGlinn Hall and residents from Grace moved to Siegfried and Knott in 1997.[100]


Entrance to Knott Hall
The most notable rector of Knott Hall is Br Jerome Meyer, C.S.C. Affectionately known by Juggerknotts as "Brojo", he was Knott's first rector as a men's dorm, and resided in Knott from 1997 to 2014. He earned his BA from Saint Edward's University and his M.Ed in Mathematics from Saint Mary's College in Winona, Minnesota.

Traditions
Knott men are called Juggerknotts.

Knott on the Knoll, the dorm's signature event, is a weekend of music hosted for the entire campus community.

McGlinn is located on West Quad, behind South Dining Hall and in between O'Neill Family Hall and Duncan Hall. Built in 1997, McGlinn is one of the newer dorms on campus and has modern day amenities, such as air conditioning and an elevator. With a capacity of 270 residents, McGlinn is the largest female dorm on campus.[104] The coat of arms is taken from the McGlinn family, with the double headed eagle, while the shamrock is the symbol of the hall.

History
Constructed in 1997 through the contributions of Terrence and Barbara McGlinn, McGlinn Hall is one of the newest dorms at the University of Notre Dame. The Angels of Knott Hall (now a male residence) moved into McGlinn in the Fall of 1997 and quickly established the dorm as one full of spirit and pride. It joins Keough, O'Neill, and Welsh Family Halls on the West Quad – sometimes called the "Suburbs" because of the modern amenities of air conditioning, elevators, and the largest rooms on campus. McGlinn enjoys a convenient location, only a brief walk to the bookstore, athletic fields, South Dining Hall and Reckers.


McGlinn Hall
Sr. Mary A. Lynch, S.S.J., M.A. is a sister of St. Joseph from Philadelphia, PA. Sr. Mary has been rector of McGlinn since August 2005 [105] and works in campus ministry as well. McGlinn residents fondly refer to Sister Mary as "Smary" and often stop by her apartment on the first floor to say hello and grab a few (or more than a few) pieces of candy.

Fr. Tom Blantz, CSC lived in McGlinn from the time its construction was completed in 1997 before moving out in 2015. He has worked as a history professor at Notre Dame and retired in 2012 to part-time teaching. Fr. Tom presided over mass in McGlinn Hall Chapel frequently. He always kept Snickers bars in a bowl outside of his apartment.

Fr. David Tyson, CSC has lived in McGlinn since August 2015. He previously worked at the university in the 1970s and 1980s before being elected president of the University of Portland. Fr. David is now the president of Holy Cross College.[106]

Marie Piccone lived in McGlinn 2017-2020.

Traditions
Casino Night is McGlinn Hall's signature event held every winter. It is a night of fun "casino-style" games, with most attendees playing roulette and blackjack with play money. All of the proceeds from the event are donated by the Shamrocks to St. Adalberts, a local grade school in South Bend. McGlinn also runs a Bubble Soccer tournament, a signature event that started in the fall of 2015, and is held in the fall and spring every year. Players create a team and play soccer while in giant, inflatable bubbles, with the proceeds also going to St. Adalberts.

McGlinn is one of the few dorms with living donors. Because of this attribute, every resident in McGlinn receives a Christmas gift from the McGlinn family in early December. In 2012, every girl received a two-pound box of assorted chocolates to ensure a maximum energy level throughout study sessions and final exams.

McGlinn has also won the Kelly Cup, an award given to the female dorm with the most participation in interhall sports, seven times, in 2009, and from 2011-2016.[107]

History
Pangborn Hall was built in 1955, named for Thomas C. Pangborn and John W. Pangborn. The Pangborns made their money manufacturing sand-blasting-type equipment. They were supporters of numerous educational, religious, scientific and charitable endeavors. Pope Pius XII named Thomas Pangborn a Knight of Malta. Pope John XXIII dubbed him a Knight of Saint Gregory the Great, and in 1964 Pope Paul VI awarded the philanthropist the title of papal count.


Pangborn Hall
It was the 15th building built on campus, and one of four that was dedicated in 1955. Pangborn and other dorms built in the 1950s were meant to be temporary housing to accommodate a spike in enrollment caused by the G.I. Bill. Pangborn represented a modernist step away from collegiate gothic. The building was designed by architects Holabird, Root and Burgee of Chicago. The hall was originally built as a residence for male students, when its nickname was the Violence, but was converted to a women's dorm in 1992 and became the Pangborn Phoxes. Pangborn again became a women’s dorm for the 2020-21 school year and became the Pangborn Phoenixes.[citation needed]

Pangborn's Chapel of the Annunciation of Our Lady, renovated in 1995, features carved-wood Stations of the Cross imported from northern Italy. The stained-glass windows honor eight saints canonized the year prior to the hall's dedication.

In January 2016 it was announced that the residents of Pangborn hall would move to the newly built Flaherty Hall. Pangborn hall will serve as a "swing hall" to host students from halls undergoing renovations: members of Walsh Hall for the 2016-17 academic year, members of Badin Hall for the 2017-2018 year, and members of Morrissey Manor for the 2018-2019 year.[108] In the 2019-2020 Pangborn housed the members of a new community to move into Johnson Family Hall. Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, Pangborn was used as housing for female students who had study abroad plans canceled as well as transfer students. There are plans for Pangborn to house the members of Sorin Hall during their now postponed renovation.[citation needed]

Traditions
The 8 sections of PE compete in the PyrOlympics, a year-round section spirit contest. Additionally, PE's signature events are also a large part of the dorm's traditions, as Pasquerilla East has forged a strong bond with its sister charity. Although not specifically labelled as a PE tradition, Flag Football is one of the top interhall sports that Pyros participate in every year. Since 2013, the dorm's flag football team (known as PEFFB) has been coached by Notre Dame football players, including DaVaris Daniels and Malik Zaire. In 2015, PEFFB was coached by Zaire as well as his teammates Sheldon Day and Cole Luke. As a result, the dorm's football team was featured on the Showtime Special A Season with Notre Dame Football as a segment on the extracurricular lives of Zaire, Day, and Luke.[110]

Siegfried is situated between Pasquerilla West Hall and Theodore Hesburgh Library on Mod Quad.


Siegfried Hall
History
Constructed in 1988 through the financial commitments of Robert M. ('37) and Raymond H. ('65) Siegfried from Tulsa. the building was converted from a female hall to a male hall in 1997 after Flanner and Grace Halls became office space. The female residents of Siegfried Hall moved to Welsh Family Hall on West Quad. After the move, the new residents adopted the nickname "Ramblers" which was one of the former names used by the University before "Fighting Irish" was adopted. Siegfried is rivals with Knott Hall, the other male Mod Quad residence hall.

Siegfried and Knott are the only two residence halls to convert from female to male, in order to preserve Mod Quad's gender balance when male dorms Flanner and Grace became offices.

Traditions
Siegfried raises funds for the South Bend Homeless Shelter through its annual Day of Man fundraiser. On this cold February day, the Ramblers venture out in only T-shirts, flip-flops, and shorts.[111] Siegfried residents are involved in activities ranging from the Notre Dame Marching Band to leadership roles in various clubs. Siegfried hosts two dances each year. The Winter Formal is held at the Warren Clubhouse. It is the only dance held at the Warren Golf Club, and is usually held the first weekend in December. Siegfried's annual retreat usually takes place in March, in a variety of places including in a state park, and across the lakes. Siegfried has a strong tradition of interhall athletic competition. The coat of arms features three gray chevrons gray on a maroon field, the colors of Siegfried.[112]

History
Stanford and Keenan, joined together in Siamese twin fashion, were built in 1957. They were designed by Ellerbe Becket and built to house 150 rooms for 300 students.[113] Keenan and Stanford are hosted in two wings of the same building, built on the spot that once hosted the toboggan of the University's minims program.[114] Constructon of the two halls was part of a 4 million dollar plan which also included North Dining Hall.[115] The building is representative of functionalist architecture with a simple double-L shape plan, a flat roof, and little exterior ornamentation.[116] Of the two, Stanford is officially a bit older as it was dedicated in October of that year (Keenan was dedicated in November). Stanford was a gift of Effa Dunn Stanford in memory of her husband Grattan T. Stanford, and was to be named the 'Effa and Grattan Stanford Hall'.[113]

Grattan Stanford, class of 1904, was graduate who would later serve as a lay trustee of the university.[113] He was an Indiana native who spent his youth in Lawrence, Kansas before attending Notre Dame. [113] Three years after his graduation he obtained a law degree from Harvard,[115] and practice law independently before becoming general counsel of the Sinclair Oil Corporation in 1916 until his death in 1949. Ella Stanford was part of Notre Dame's Women's Advisory Council.[113]

When the hall first opened, it was the first to have study halls and television lounges.[117] Until the mid-60s, it was a hall for incoming freshmen.

Description
Stanford is a four-story building, built in minimalist and undadorned shapes, constructed in buff brick and limestone finishes.[113][117][115] Stanford and Keenan share the Chapel of the Holy Cross, located off the lobby, which has a series of exquisite stained-glass windows featuring various types of crosses. Its highlight is Mestrovic's 13-foot mahogany crucifix, which the artist-in-residence executed especially for the chapel in 1957. Originally, the crucifix hung above a companion altar made of travertine marble imported from Italy. The altar was removed in the wake of Vatican II changes, but the Mestrovic crucifix remained. Another of Mestrovic's works, a wood carving titled Christ as Young Boy Teaching, is present in the lobby.


Stanford Hall entrance
Traditions
Stanford Hall's mascot is the Griffin. Its original mascot was a stud bull, hence the moniker "Stanford Studs". According to Notre Dame Magazine, "the switch was made in February 1999 to honor Father Robert F. Griffin, CSC, University chaplain for 30 years and a campus icon until his death in October 1999."[118][119]

Stanford's traditional rival dorm is its twin Keenan Hall. Every year their interhall football matchup is deemed "The Battle for the Chapel" with the winner gaining naming rights to the chapel.[120][121] Recently, Stanford has retained the chapel naming rights in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Despite the fact that the two dorms share two front doors side-by-side and the chapel has two entrances, it is tradition for the men of each dorm to only use the door's of their dorm.[122]
